## Project 1a Introduction

This is the beginning of first group programming project in CS5300. This first part of the Project should be done individually. That is, we want every student to implement it independently and turn it in to CMS. For Part b of the project (which will be posted shortly), you will transform this code into a distributed session state database running in Amazon AWS. For that part of the Project you should form groups of 3 persons. You may form a group of 4 persons if you wish; but you should talk to Professor Demers first. You may also form a 1- or 2-person group, but a small group will be expected to do all the work of a 3-person group.
The next project (Project 1b) will use AWS EC2, AWS SimpleDB or DynamoDB, and other Amazon Web Services to build a scalable and fault-tolerant website. This site will be very simple -- it will do nothing but maintain and display session state. It will run in in multiple Apache Tomcat instances, which will run Java Servlet (and/or JSP) code implementing the behavior of your site, together with additional Java code your group will write to implement a scalable, distributed, fault-tolerant, in-memory session state database using algorithms closely related to the SSM system discussed in lecture.
In the current assignment (Project 1a) you will write some of the Servlet or JSP code you will need, and test that code on your own machine (with no load balancer or distributed session state database).
